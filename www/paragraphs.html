	The idea is simple - you shouldn’t have to build up a pile of code to make social relationships work. Instead focus on what you do best and let us do the heavy lifting. Let us set up the servers and manage the traffic and maintain the groups and track what content is popular and give it to you. You just focus on the core of your business. We’ve got your back (even if your customers can’t see it). After all, they’re your customers, not ours.
