<p>Logline: Suit & Tie Guy works as a professional musician in the type of town from which most creative spirits set sail; a homegrown Penelope to the migrantâ€™s Odysseus, he embodies what can be learned by staying, and what is lost by leaving.


<hr/>

<p>I grew up in the archetypical American city, Peoria, Illinois; a place where conservative, small-town values mix with big-city issues like a rotting urban core and poor public schools. Peoria of the early 1990s was colored by a national wave of teenage nihilism. The early part of the decade saw heights of youth suicide and teenage pregnancy which was reflected in popular music as Grunge and Gangsta Rap. Peoria's youth embraced this in our burgeoning local music scene. Taxi War Dance, Bloody Mess and the Skabs, Dollface, Rugg City, Danse Macabre, and the ubiquitous teenage promoter Suit & Tie Guy were from a place and time as unique as any decade. Fleeting, often imitated, but never replicated - the sounds from that era were a cacophonous expression of a dissatisfied youth.

<p>Things change as they always do. Suit & Tie Guy quit promoting. Many aspiring musicians left Peoria for bigger markets. No longer does it matter if a show "Plays in Peoria." That vaudevillian phrase is from the river city's more liberal glory years. If you have a grand aspiration, common sense tells you that you leave and try to achieve it somewhere else.

<p>But Suit & Tie Guy didn't leave. He stayed in his birth town of Chillicothe, Illinois just outside of the city and carved out a living for himself as a professional musician. He represents the unheralded wisdom of staying. While Odysseus' adventures are romanticized, there is a deep wisdom and piety in Penelope's patience. She passed the time while committing herself to a meaningful craft. Odysseus came back with nothing tangible, not even the evidence that his quest ever transpired.

<p>
There is a power in staying. Suit & Tie Guy lives amongst his past, connected to it in a way that no transplant in New York City or Los Angeles could ever hope to be, regardless of words they write or pictures they paint. It gives him a special, relaxed creative power that evades those who seek it. Long after the gutter punks from his formative years have given up on their musical aspirations and returned to Peoria, Suit & Tie Guy is living his. His company, STG/Soundlabs, now builds synthesizer modules used across the world. His studio on 2nd Avenue is a destination, attracting visitors nearly every evening from all over the Midwest. They are there to create music, talk shop, and enjoy friendship late into the night.

<p>
Visiting Chillicothe is at first hardly distinguishable from any other Midwestern town. Its main thoroughfare, Route 29, is lined with Taco Bell drive throughs and BP gas stations. Veering off the beaten path and heading towards the river reveals 2nd Avenue - the heart and soul of Chillicothe. Wide sidewalks and local businesses create an identifiable, leisurely, character. Suit & Tie Guy's studio sits squarely centered in downtown and only a few Hammond organ window displays hint at what's happening inside. He loves Chillicothe and proudly lives ensconced in its history, studies it, and appreciates it. But it's not a deep, romantic love. There are no stories of what makes Chillicothe great or how it has made him who he is. So many of us have built narratives based on where we came from - "made wise by the tough streets of Baltimore," "learning the value of hard work growing up in Cleveland," or "taught the value of nature in the mountains of Colorado." These myths help feed our identity. But Suit & Tie Guy's objectively suggests that growing up in Chillicothe is much like growing up in any other small town. Chillicothe is special, the hilly Illinois River valley alone separates it from the prototypical Midwestern town, but in terms of making him who he is today, he puts very little credence into that.

<p>
I can list a dozen ways that growing up in Peoria shaped who I am. But how many of those dozen are distinctly by virtue of Peoria? I'll never know how the early 90s Peoria music scene compared to what happened concurrently in Akron, Ohio or Visalia, California but I talk as if 1990s Peoria had something worth remembering. Romanticizing the past is the hallmark of the restless traveler. Odysseus was plagued by nostalgia, as is the contemporary urban transplant. Every city dotted with Mexican Cantinas and German Beer Halls admits to a deep longing for home, the true home. Every immigrant shares the same dream of returning triumphantly. Suit & Tie Guy has no such longing. It makes him unique amongst most artists. He has one less possible future that most. He can never return because he never left.

<p>
Suit & Tie Guy's past is not a causal train of events but an amorphous cloud of memories. In other words, one event didn't lead to another in any sort of remarkable way. There are few serendipitous encounters. He's a musician because he was born that way; he has always worn a suit and tie because he always has; he is in Chillicothe because that's where his family and friends live. He is unencumbered by a past or a pedigree. This evades most of us who twist and turn through life, mapping out past events and their relationships to current ones. It imbues Suit & Tie Guy with a sense of inevitability. He is who he is, unapologetic, and that identity lead him to where he is today. It was not fate. Fate is romantic and out of our control. Inevitable outcomes are only realized through dedication and perseverance. If he was ridiculed as a teenager wearing a suit and tie, it only made him more dedicated to who he is, not who other people want him to be.

<p>
When I think of archetypical Midwestern values, dedication and perseverance are two that top that list. When I think of Peoria, I think of those special, insufferable, angsty days of hair dye and local shows at run-down bowling alleys and abandoned warehouses. But that's my unchanging memory, mapped onto a city that is much larger and more complex, romanticized and egocentric. The same can be said of some supposedly special "Midwestern values" that are fabricated by the indigenous and spread around the continent by the echoes of hearsay.


<p>
Our past is as malleable as our future. Witnessing the slow burn of events firsthand, as Suit & Tie Guy has, reveals the larger cycles and ancient rhythms that make our life-changing decisions look as insignificant as they truly are. The traveler cannot see this. Every destination is a new lifetime. Every past locale is sequenced in such a way that it fits neatly into a chain of events. But memories are as fragile as our identity. One change in the order of our DNA and we would be a totally different person. Suit & Tie Guy was given the tools to be Suit & Tie Guy the day he was born. It is his acceptance of his station in life that has allowed it to happen.
